		<h2>Definition</h2>
		<p>Bright patterns are aspirational design solutions that prioritize ethical considerations over established design conventions. They are design solutions that prioritize user goals and well-being over their desires and business objectives.</p>

		<h2>Examples</h2>

		<div class="pattern">
			<h3>Slow down</h3>
			<p>This pattern involves friction in interaction by adding extra steps or barriers to prevent users from engaging in harmful or addictive behaviors. For example, a social media app may require users to confirm their intention before posting a potentially toxic comment, or an app intentionally takes longer to open up.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="pattern">
			<h3>Escape hatch</h3>
			<p>Making it easy for users to leave a situation or cancel a subscription. For example, providing a clear and accessible option to cancel membership or delete profile. </p>
		</div>

		<div class="pattern">
			<h3>Simple Consent</h3>
			<p>This pattern involves obtaining clear and unambiguous consent from the user before collecting, using, or sharing their personal data. This can involve providing clear explanations of how the data will be used and providing easy-to-use options for opting in or out. </p>
		</div>

		<div class="pattern">
			<h3>Honest defaults</h3>
			<p> This pattern involves setting default options that are in the best interest of the user, rather than the business. For example, a default option to unsubscribe from marketing emails may be provided, rather than requiring users to opt-out.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="pattern">
			<h3>Nutrition labels</h3>
			<p>The nutrition label pattern is a design element that provides users with clear and transparent information about the impact of a particular action or decision. For example, a food delivery app may show users the nutritional information of each dish they order, such as calories, fat, sugar etc., or a travel booking app may show users the environmental impact of each flight they book, such as carbon emissions etc..</p>
		</div>
		<div class="pattern">
			<h3>Persona profiling</h3>
			<p>The app or website transparently informs users of the categories or groups they are being placed into based on their data, allowing them to better understand how they are being profiled and how their experience may differ from other users.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="pattern">
			<h3>Healthy alternative/5-a-day</h3>
			<p>The platform suggests higher quality content, still of interest to the user, but may discourage mindless usage. This pattern respects the user’s well-being and attention, and does not try to exploit their curiosity or boredom into consuming more content than they need or want. For example, a social media app may suggest users to watch educational videos or read informative articles instead of scrolling through endless feeds of memes or gossip, or a gaming app may suggest users to play games that are more challenging or rewarding instead of games that are more addictive or repetitive.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="pattern">
			<h3>Usage limits</h3>
			<p>Often implemented in external well-being and child control apps, these are patterns within apps that limit usage time to healthy levels.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="pattern">
			<h3>Transparent recommender</h3>
			<p>This pattern involves revealing the logic or criteria behind the recommendations or suggestions that are provided to the user. For example, a streaming service may explain why a certain show or movie is recommended based on the user’s preferences, ratings, or viewing history, or an e-commerce site may disclose how sponsored products are ranked or selected.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="pattern">
			<h3>Dumb it down</h3>
			<p>This pattern involves providing users with clear and understandable explanations of how their data is processed or used by an AI system. These explanations can be visual, personalized, and even counterfactual. For example, a health app may visually show how it calculates the user's risk of developing a certain condition based on their data, or a credit-scoring system may provide a personalized explanation of how it determines the user's creditworthiness based on their data.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="pattern">
			<h3>Data traces</h3>
			<p>This pattern involves showing users the traces or records of their data that are stored, shared, or accessed by an app or website. For example, a messaging app may show users when their messages are read, forwarded, or deleted by others, or a search engine may show users their search history and how it affects their results.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="pattern">
			<h3>Cost transparency</h3>
			<p>This pattern involves showing users the detailed breakdown of the costs involved in producing and selling a product or service. This pattern respects the user’s curiosity and trust, and does not try to hide or inflate the margins or profits of the vendor. For example, showing users how much the product cost in purchase, marketing, return and shipping.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="pattern">
			<h3>Outside my bubble</h3>
			<p>This pattern involves exposing users to different perspectives or opinions frequently that challenge their existing beliefs or preferences. For example, a news aggregator may show users articles from diverse sources or a music streaming service may suggest songs from genres that they usually don’t listen to.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="pattern">
			<h3>Contrarian’s companion</h3>
			<p>This pattern provides critique on consumed and posted content. For example, it shows, views with different political leanings than theirs, and makes users reflect on their opinions.</p>
		</div>
